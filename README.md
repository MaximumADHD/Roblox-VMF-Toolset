# Roblox VMF Toolset
A set of scripts for porting Roblox maps into Garry's Mod and other Source games.
Currently this only supports plastic `Block` geometry with surface properties. Other shapes (i.e. meshes, `Ball`, `Cylinder`, etc.) should be ported by hand as models.

All of Roblox's BrickColors are provided with each surface type pre-baked. I've also provided the source files for some of the maps I've published.
